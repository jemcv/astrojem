*"The world is a dangerous place, Elliott, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing." â€• Mr. Robot*

Here's a list of practices I follow to keep myself secure:

- **Log out of unused sessions**: This prevents unauthorized access from other devices.
- **Check authorized devices**: Regularly review the devices that can access your accounts.
- **Use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: For an extra layer of security when logging in.
- **Use strong, unique passwords or a password manager**: This makes it harder for attackers to guess passwords.
- **Check URLs before logging in**: This helps avoid phishing attacks.
- **Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts**: A security breach on one site can't compromise others if unique passwords are used.
- **Keep apps up to date**: Updates include security patches to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Check browser extensions**: Some extensions might be malicious and compromise security.
- **Check third-party access of apps**: To prevent unwanted access to accounts through connected apps.
- **Don't click on suspicious links**: This helps avoid phishing attempts and malware.
- **In social media**: Be mindful of what you share publicly, it can be misused and exploited.

Apps I use: 

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) securely stores passwords and sensitive information.

- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) encrypts internet connection for enhanced privacy and security.

Additional resources:

Check if your email is part of a data breach: [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) 

Check your password strength: [Bitwarden's Password Strength Checker](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/) 

By following these simple steps, you can significantly improve your online security. Stay safe out there!
