I created a new personal website using Astro. Below is the list of its features.
![astrologo-light](https://docs.astro.build/assets/full-logo-light.png)

1. **Minimalist Design**: It provides a clean, minimalistic design, focusing on usability.
2. **RSS Support**: It has RSS feed support, allowing users to subscribe and receive updates.
3. **Optimized Performance**: The website achieves a 100 score across every Lighthouse category.
4. **Markdown Layout**: The website utilizes Tailwind CSS Typography. This ensures enhanced readability providing good user experience when browsing through the site's posts.
5. **Blog Post Creation**: Supports the creation of blog posts under two categories - 'writes' and 'notes'. It also supports draft posts, allowing posts to be prepared and saved for later publication.
6. **Reading Time Indicator**: Each post on the site includes an estimated reading time, providing users with an idea of how long it will take to read through the posts.

Below is the initial prototype and design.

This personal website is hosted on Vercel and uses a .me domain from Namecheap. Development began in December, and the site is subject to future changes and feature additions :).
